# Codename ReProgress
Codename ReProgress is an in-development Progressbar95 hypercasual UI fangame which focuses on source-accurate systems and new mechanics/features.

The concept of the fangame was discussed a short while ago, but it wasn't until the 26th of August 2022 that we finally started to work on the project.
We hope this project will get praised by others in the Progressbar95 community. If not, we'll resolve the potential problems they'll have.
