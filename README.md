# ReProgress
Reprogress is a **revival of ProgressCLI,** ProgressCLI was **shutdown at 25/7/22** because the repo owner (BurningInferno) said he had more projects to do instead.  
At **26/8/22 we disscussed the revival of ProgressCLI,** and accepted the job. The main language is still Python.  
We hope this project can be more successful than the old ProgressCLI

Original ProgressCLI: [Here](https://github.com/Delta-Code-Repository/ProgressCLI95).
